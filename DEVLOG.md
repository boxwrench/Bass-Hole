# Development Log

This file tracks development sessions, decisions, and context for continuity across sessions and devices. Claude (or any AI assistant) should read this first when picking up the project.

---

## Project Status

**Current State:** v0.2.0 - Core gameplay functional, sprite integration in progress
**Primary Goal:** Idle fishing game for ESP32 CYD (Cheap Yellow Display)
**Related Project:** [DIST_ESP32-CYD-Tester](../DIST_ESP32-CYD-Tester) - Hardware config tool (use this to get CYD settings)

---

## Quick Context for New Sessions

```
This repo: ESP32 fishing idle game "Bass Hole"
Hardware: ESP32 CYD 2.4" (TZT variant, ILI9341 + XPT2046)
Tech stack: PlatformIO, TFT_eSPI, XPT2046_Touchscreen
Key issue being solved: Display color handling (sprites vs primitives)
```

**Critical Hardware Findings:**
- USB count determines driver: single=ILI9341, dual=ST7789
- TFT_BGR color order required for correct colors
- Touch uses SEPARATE SPI pins (25, 32, 33, 36, 39) - not display pins
- Touch rotation is INDEPENDENT from display rotation
- Sprites and primitives behave differently with invertDisplay()

## Session Log

### 2026-01-19 - Sprite Color Resolution (VERIFIED ON HARDWARE)

**What was done:**
- Ran comprehensive color diagnostic tests on ESP32-2432S028R hardware
- Identified root cause of washed-out sprite colors: **default gamma curve**
- Established verified "Ground Truth" configuration for Bass-Hole project
- Tested all 4 gamma curves (0x01, 0x02, 0x04, 0x08) on actual hardware

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:**
The washed-out sprite issue was **NOT** a byte-swap or RGB-order problem—it was the default gamma curve being incompatible with the specific panel variant used in the CYD.

**Verified Configuration:**
- Driver: `ILI9341_2_DRIVER` (fixes static/corruption)
- **Gamma: 0x01** (CRITICAL for vibrant sprite colors)
- Inversion: `invertDisplay(true)` (required with _2_DRIVER variant)
- Rotation: `1` (landscape, USB down)
- Sprites: RGB565 Little-Endian with `setSwapBytes(true)`

**Why this matters:**
- `fillRect()` and UI elements look fine with default gamma
- `pushImage()` sprites appear washed out/desaturated with default gamma
- This made diagnosis extremely difficult—colors weren't "wrong," just muted
- Gamma 0x01 restores full vibrancy to sprites

**Asset Pipeline Update:**
- Use `tools/png_to_rgb565.py` (RGB mode, NOT --bgr)
- Firmware: `setSwapBytes(true)` after `tft.init()`
- Result: Accurate colors with crisp outlines

**Next steps:**
- Update Bass-Hole graphics.cpp with gamma setting
- Regenerate all sprite assets using verified RGB565 pipeline
- Test on hardware to confirm vibrant colors

**Blocking issues:** None

### 2026-01-15 - Pivot to Hardware-First Approach

**What was done:**
- Decided to pivot development strategy
- Enhanced DIST_ESP32-CYD-Tester to be comprehensive hardware validation tool
- Goal: Solve all hardware config issues in CYD-Tester, then use those settings here
- Created DEVLOG.md for session continuity

**Key decisions:**
- Hardware testing/research now happens in DIST_ESP32-CYD-Tester repo
- Bass-Hole will use Wokwi for UI/gameplay development
- CYD_Config.h generated by tester will be imported here

**Next steps for Bass-Hole:**
- Sync `ILI9341_2_DRIVER` and 55MHz settings from CYD-Tester (pending hardware test)
- Continue Phase 2 sprite work using Wokwi-First development

**Blocking issues:**
- Sprite colors need verification after config sync

---

### 2026-01-17 - Sprite Workflow Validation & Wokwi Research

**What was done:**
- Verified PNG-to-RGB565 conversion tools (`img2code.py`, `img2raw.py`)
- Created test sprites and confirmed RGB565 values are correct
- Researched Wokwi community projects for ESP32 CYD optimization patterns
- Adopted **Wokwi-First** development strategy for UI/gameplay logic
- Documented findings in `docs/WOKWI_RESEARCH.md`

**Key findings:**
- **Tool Verification:** Both conversion tools produce correct RGB565 output
- **Wokwi Gems:** Found elite optimization patterns (row-buffer rendering, LovyanGFX, multi-core)
- **Development Strategy:** Wokwi provides visual feedback for agent development without hardware dependency
- **Proposed Changes:** ILI9341_2_DRIVER + 55MHz (from CYD-Tester) pending hardware test

**Files changed:**
- tools/img2raw.py - Created raw binary converter
- docs/WOKWI_RESEARCH.md - Cataloged community optimization patterns
- Removed obsolete Wokwi test stubs (cleanup)

**Next steps:**
- Test ILI9341_2_DRIVER + 55MHz on Bass-Hole hardware
- Document results
- Update all docs to reflect verified config

---

### 2026-01-14 - Phase 2 Sprite Integration

**What was done:**
- Integrated sprite rendering for fish
- Discovered sprite vs primitive color conflict
- Documented findings in docs/PHASE2_FINDINGS.md

**Key findings:**
- With invertDisplay(false): Sprites correct, UI wrong
- With invertDisplay(true): UI correct, sprites may need adjustment
- Solution: Use invertDisplay(true) + normal RGB565 values
- Touch Y-axis is inverted on TZT hardware

**Files changed:**
- graphics.cpp - sprite rendering, display config
- touch.cpp - calibration values
- config.h - color constants
- docs/PHASE2_FINDINGS.md - comprehensive findings

### Earlier Sessions

See CHANGELOG.md for version history:
- 0.1.0 - Initial structure
- 0.1.1 - Hardware debugging (backlight, BGR)
- 0.1.2 - Touch calibration fix
- 0.1.3 - Phase 1 finalization (Buy Fish button)
- 0.2.0 - PlatformIO migration

## Architecture Notes

```
Game Loop:
1. Update fish AI (hunger, movement, growth)
2. Check for coin drops
3. Handle touch input (feed, collect coins, buy fish)
4. Render frame (background, fish, UI, coins)
5. Auto-save periodically

File Structure:
src/main.cpp      - Entry point, game loop
src/fish.cpp      - Fish AI and behavior
src/touch.cpp     - Touch handling
src/graphics.cpp  - All rendering
src/save.cpp      - SD card persistence
include/config.h  - Game constants, colors
include/sprites/  - Sprite data (RGB565 arrays)
```

## Hardware Config (TZT ESP32 CYD 2.4")

```cpp
// Display
tft.setRotation(0);       // Portrait, USB at bottom
tft.invertDisplay(true);  // Determined by color test

// Touch
touch.setRotation(1);     // Different from display!
#define TOUCH_MIN_X  600
#define TOUCH_MAX_X  3600
#define TOUCH_MIN_Y  500
#define TOUCH_MAX_Y  3600

// Mapping (Y inverted)
mappedX = map(p.x, TOUCH_MAX_X, TOUCH_MIN_X, 0, SCREEN_WIDTH);
mappedY = map(p.y, TOUCH_MIN_Y, TOUCH_MAX_Y, 0, SCREEN_HEIGHT);
```
